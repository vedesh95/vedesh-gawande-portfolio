## Quick Setup

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Check your installation by running:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. In the project directory, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

5. Customize the template by navigating to the `/src/components` directory. Modify texts, pictures, and other information as needed.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

If you are interested in creating a mockup image like the ones from the personal projects section, I recommend [Genmoo](https://gemoo.com/tools/browser-mockup-generator/). This website lets you generate sleek looking browser mockups for free.

## Deployment

You can choose your preferred service (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)) for deployment. One of the easiest ways to host this portfolio is using GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions below for a production deploy.

1. **Set Up GitHub Repository**

    Create a new repository on GitHub for your portfolio app.

2. **Configure `package.json`**

    Edit the following properties in your `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
        "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
        "scripts": {
            "predeploy": "npm run build",
            "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your GitHub repository.

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

    Run the following command to deploy your app:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

4. **Access Your Deployed App**

    After successfully deploying, you can access your app at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`.
